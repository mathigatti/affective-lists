# emotions2json (WIP)

List of behavioural, emotional and physiological words and concepts + its attributes (WIP). Inspired by the concept of [somatic makers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_marker_hypothesis).

## Procedure

I collected some samples from the sources listed below and I turned that in JSON format with chatGPT help. It's a work in progress, help is very much welcomed.

## Project Structure

### Emotions

It will contain a long list of emotions and its characteristics, check anger.json

### Behaviour and Physiology

It will contain a list of behaviours and physiological states, check giongo.json

### Nervous System

It contains a table (Comprehensive_Nervous_System_Substances_Overview.csv) that lists different neurotransmitters and other psychoactive substances that affect our emotions and perception, and its characteristics (It was made using chatGPT so it probably has errors).
