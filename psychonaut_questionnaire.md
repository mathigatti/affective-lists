# Psychonaut Questionnaire 

The goal is to assist individuals in identifying and understanding
changes in their perception, cognition, emotions, or physiology caused

expands on incomplete sections, organizes questions for clarity, and
adds missing dimensions to ensure a comprehensive assessment.
